1)  VERY IMPORTANT**- Compilation/make command: in the terminal when in the directory with the source file and makefile
      type "make" to compile, then in the terminal type "./loco" to run the program(DO NOT click the loco executable, not reliable).
      after typing "./loco" the program will run properly.

2) I only have 2_1 program up and running. I have the bulk of program 2_2 in the same main file commented out.
                program 2_2: i first stored the key file in a vector then stored the file to be encrypted in another vector.
                i attempted to sort the would-be encrypted file using vector sort,using the key vector as the guide.
                unfortunately, the sort library wouldn't function properly.
                I then had the code to insert the would-be encrypted vector elements back into the file using ofstream.

3) to run program 2_1: type the name of the text file, my testing file was "example.txt".
                      then type "p" or "u", for padding and unpadding respectively.
                      finally type the padding bytes length, for example i tested the program with "8".

4) You will see results both in the terminal and in the file!!!!
